        <div class="blog-area">
            <p>Promise is a JavaScipt Object that simply links consuming and producing codes.It holds the upcoming value of an async operation. Before ES6 callbacks functions were used to handle async tasks which can lead to a callback hell.Promise helps to avoid that.<span id="dots1">......</span></p>
            <span id="more1">
                <p>There are three states of Promise.<br>
                    <span class="highlight">Unresolved - </span>If the result is not ready then the promise is unresolved.<br>
                    <span class="highlight">Resolved - </span>If the result is ready then the promise is resolved<br>
                    <span class="highlight">Rejected - </span>If an error occured then promise is rejected<br><br>
                </p>
                <h2>Creating a Promise</h2>
                    <p class="syntax">const myPromise = new Promise(function(myResolve,myReject){<br>
                        myResolve(); // When Successful<br>
                        myReject(); //When Error<br>
                    }); 
                    </p><br>
                <p>A new promise is created using Promise constructor. It takes a single argument(a callback), which takes two callbacks, resolve and reject.
                </p><br><br>
                <h2>Promise Instance Methods</h2>
                    <p><span class="highlight">then, catch</span> and <span class="highlight">finally </span>are three main Promise API methods
                    </p><br>
                    <p><span class="highlight">Promise then - </span>It notifies when a asynchronous operation is completed, either successful or fail. Multiple promises can be chained together using it.<br>
                        <p class="syntax">promise.then(Success);<br>
                            Promise.resolve()<br>
                            .then(() => console.log('then#1'))<br>
                            .then(() => console.log('then#2'))<br>
                            .then(() => console.log('then#3'));
                        </p>
                    </p><br>
                    <p>All promises are resolved and following then are called, so output will be
                        <p class="syntax">then#1<br>
                            then#2<br>
                            then#3<br>
                        </p>
                    </p><br>
                    <p><span class="highlight">Promise catch - </span>It takes a function as an argument that handles error if occured. It is never called if everthing goes well<br>
                        <p class="syntax">promise.catch(Error);<br>
                            Promise.resolve()<br>
                            .then(a)<br>
                            .catch(console.error)
                        </p>
                    </p><br>
                    <p><span class="highlight">Promise then - </span>It is only called when the promise is resolved. If a piece of code is to be executed after .then and .catch then it is used<br>
                        <p class="syntax">Promise.resolve()<br>
                            .then(a)<br>
                            .then(b)<br>
                            .catch(console.error)<br>
                            .finally(() => console.log('always called'))
